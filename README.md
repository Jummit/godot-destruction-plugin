## Usage

1. Install the **Cell Fracture** addon in Blender, **join your mesh** and use **F3** to search for Cell Fracture. Set the Source Limit to how many RigidBodies you want in your game. (\~5 â€“ 20)
2. Select everything, right click and select `Set Origin > Origin to Center of Mass (Volume)`.
3. Export it as a .ojb or GLTF, import it in Godot **as a scene** and create an **instance** of this scene.
4. For Godot **3** Install and **enable** the **Destruction plugin** from the asset library. On Godot **4** and above, currently the best method is to download this repository; and extract the **addons/** folder into the root of your project. It can then be enabled under plugin settings as usual.
5. Add a **Destruction** node to the **intact** scene and set the `Fragmented` scene to the **fragmented** scene.
6. Set the `Shard Container` to the node the fragmented objects will be added to at runtime or leave it empty.
7. Call **destroy()** to destroy the object.
