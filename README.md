For Godot **3** install and enable the **Destruction plugin** from the asset library.

For Godot **4** and above, download the addon from the [releases](https://github.com/Jummit/godot-destruction-plugin/releases) and put the contents in the `addons` folder. It can then be enabled under plugin settings as usual.

## Usage

1. Install the **Cell Fracture** addon in Blender, **join your mesh** and use **F3** to search for Cell Fracture. Set the Source Limit to how many RigidBodies you want in your game. (\~5 â€“ 20)
2. Select everything, right click and select `Set Origin > Origin to Center of Mass (Volume)`.
3. Export it as a .ojb or GLTF, import it in Godot **as a scene** and create an **instance** of this scene.
4. Add a `Destruction` node to the **intact** node and set the `Fragmented` scene to the **fragmented** scene.
5. Call `destroy()` to destroy the object.
